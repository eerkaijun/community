## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->

A decentralised ticketing marketplace with three core features:
1. Use of smart contract to regulate the secondary market - currently popular events often end up with high ticket resale price
2. Each ticket is represented as an NFT - elimininate tickets fraud and ticket could become collectible at the end of event
3. Pre-event financing option - often times event organisers struggle to obtain loan from centralised institutions, our platform offer a decentralised method to raise loan from individual investors

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->

* IPFS: ticket details are stored in IPFS to reduce on chain cost, while hash-based mechanism of IPFS also offers a tamper-proof ticket details
* Filecoin: ticket is represented as an NFT and become collectible after event starts, therefore leveraging Filecoin for persistent storage
